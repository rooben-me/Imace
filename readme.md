# Imace - Find your photos Easily ðŸ“·âœ¨

Imace is a web application that allows you to search your images using natural language and explore them in an interactive 3D space.

## Features

- **Natural Language Search:** Find your photos by describing them, just like you would to a friend!
- **Interactive 3D Visualization:** Explore your images in a 3D space, revealing visual relationships between them.
- **Local Processing:** All processing happens on your machine, ensuring your privacy.

## How it works

Imace uses the CLIP model to encode your images and search queries, allowing for accurate semantic matching.
